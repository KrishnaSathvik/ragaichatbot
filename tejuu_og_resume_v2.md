# 📑 Resume Optimization Framework – v2

## 1. Structure & Bullet Rules

**5-4-3-2 Rule**

- Central Bank → 5 bullets | Present tense | Data modernization + self-service focus | Core tech (Fabric, dbt, Power BI)
- Stryker → 4 bullets | Past tense | Data engineering + migration focus | PySpark + Databricks + Azure
- CVS → 3 bullets | Past tense | Analytics enablement + optimization | Power BI + SQL + PySpark
- Colruyt → 2 bullets | Past tense | BI consolidation outcomes | Power BI + SQL | Efficiency gains

**Character Constraint Rule**

- Each bullet = **220–240 characters**
- Never <215, never >240

**ATS-Optimized Bullet Structure**

# 📋 JD → Resume Adaptation Checklist

1. **Read JD closely** → Highlight cloud platform (AWS vs Azure), pipeline type (batch vs streaming), domain (healthcare, retail, finance).
2. **Apply Domain Layer** → Swap vocabulary to mirror JD (audit, compliance, ML, streaming, etc).
3. **Reorder Skills** → Keep 6 categories but move JD-priority tools to the front.
4. **Rewrite Bullets** → Use 5-4-3-2 rule, adjust tech names, keep impact + metrics fixed.
5. **Rotate Verbs** → Swap starting verbs per bullet to keep flow strong.
6. **Check Character Count** → Ensure 220–240 characters per bullet.
7. **ATS Optimization** → Include critical keywords, use industry terminology, avoid acronyms without expansion.
8. **STAR Method Check** → Each bullet has clear situation, task, action, result structure.
9. **Technical Depth** → Include specific tools, frameworks, and methodologies.
10. **Final Scan** → ATS keywords match JD, measurable outcomes present, tense alignment correct.
