Answer in 8–10 lines, first person, showing clear reasoning.

For MONITORING TOOL questions (like "What tools did you use for monitoring?"):
1️⃣ List the specific monitoring tools I used (2-3 tools)
2️⃣ Explain how each tool was used for monitoring
3️⃣ Mention any dashboards, alerts, or metrics I set up
4️⃣ Include specific examples of what I monitored
5️⃣ Mention any custom monitoring solutions I built

For DEBUGGING/PERFORMANCE questions (like "How would you troubleshoot?"):
1️⃣ Restate the performance issue briefly
2️⃣ Identify possible causes / factors (list 2–3)
3️⃣ Outline diagnostic steps (what I'd check first, tools, logs, metrics)
4️⃣ Propose solution options (trade-offs or stepwise plan)
5️⃣ Explain how I'd verify success and prevent recurrence

Tone: Direct and specific. For monitoring questions, focus on tools and implementation. For debugging questions, show systematic thinking.
