# Data Engineering Interview Guide - Tejuu's Experience

## Introduction
**Tejuu's Interview Philosophy:**
Having interviewed for data engineering roles at Central Bank of Missouri, Stryker, and CVS Health, I've learned what interviewers look for in data engineers. My approach focuses on demonstrating technical depth, business understanding, and problem-solving skills. Let me share the patterns and strategies that have helped me succeed in data engineering interviews.

## Technical Interview Preparation

### 1. Core Data Engineering Concepts
**Tejuu's Key Concepts to Master:**

**ETL vs ELT:**
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Traditional approach where data is transformed before loading into target system
- **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform):** Modern approach where raw data is loaded first, then transformed using target system's compute power
- **When to use each:** ETL for complex transformations, ELT for large-scale data processing

**Data Warehousing:**
- **Star Schema:** Fact table surrounded by dimension tables
- **Snowflake Schema:** Normalized dimension tables
- **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD):** Type 1 (overwrite), Type 2 (historical), Type 3 (previous value)
- **Data Marts:** Subject-specific data warehouses

**Data Lake vs Data Warehouse:**
- **Data Lake:** Raw, unstructured data storage (Hadoop, S3, ADLS)
- **Data Warehouse:** Structured, processed data for analytics (SQL Server, Snowflake, Redshift)
- **Data Lakehouse:** Hybrid approach combining both (Delta Lake, Iceberg)

### 2. SQL Interview Questions
**Tejuu's Common SQL Questions:**

**Question 1: Find customers with highest transaction amounts**
```sql
-- My approach: Use window functions for ranking
WITH CustomerTotals AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        SUM(transaction_amount) AS total_amount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(transaction_amount) DESC) AS rank
    FROM transactions
    WHERE transaction_date >= DATEADD(month, -12, GETDATE())
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id, total_amount
FROM CustomerTotals
WHERE rank <= 10;
```

**Question 2: Calculate running totals**
```sql
-- My approach: Use window functions with ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    transaction_date,
    transaction_amount,
    SUM(transaction_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id 
        ORDER BY transaction_date 
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) AS running_total
FROM transactions
ORDER BY customer_id, transaction_date;
```

**Question 3: Find duplicate records**
```sql
-- My approach: Use window functions to identify duplicates
WITH DuplicateCheck AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id, transaction_id 
            ORDER BY created_date DESC
        ) AS row_num
    FROM transactions
)
SELECT *
FROM DuplicateCheck
WHERE row_num > 1;
```

### 3. Python Interview Questions
**Tejuu's Python Data Engineering Questions:**

**Question 1: Process large CSV file efficiently**
```python
# My approach: Use chunking and memory optimization
import pandas as pd
import gc

def process_large_csv(file_path, chunk_size=10000):
    """Process large CSV file in chunks"""
    processed_chunks = []
    
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunk_size):
        # Process chunk
        chunk_processed = (
            chunk
            .dropna(subset=['customer_id', 'amount'])
            .assign(
                amount=pd.to_numeric(chunk['amount'], errors='coerce'),
                processed_at=pd.Timestamp.now()
            )
        )
        processed_chunks.append(chunk_processed)
        
        # Memory management
        if len(processed_chunks) > 10:
            combined = pd.concat(processed_chunks, ignore_index=True)
            yield combined
            processed_chunks = []
            gc.collect()
    
    # Return remaining chunks
    if processed_chunks:
        yield pd.concat(processed_chunks, ignore_index=True)
```

**Question 2: Data quality validation**
```python
# My approach: Create reusable validation framework
class DataQualityValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = {}
    
    def add_rule(self, name, rule_function):
        self.rules[name] = rule_function
    
    def validate(self, df):
        results = {}
        for name, rule in self.rules.items():
            results[name] = rule(df)
        return results
    
    def check_completeness(self, df):
        """Check for null values in required fields"""
        required_fields = ['customer_id', 'amount', 'date']
        errors = []
        
        for field in required_fields:
            if field in df.columns:
                null_count = df[field].isnull().sum()
                if null_count > 0:
                    errors.append(f"{field}: {null_count} null values")
        
        return {'status': 'PASS' if not errors else 'FAIL', 'errors': errors}
```

## System Design Interview

### 1. Design a Data Pipeline
**Tejuu's Approach to Pipeline Design:**

**Requirements:**
- Process 1TB of transaction data daily
- Support real-time analytics
- Handle data quality issues
- Scale to 10x current volume

**My Design:**

```
Data Sources → Data Lake → Processing → Data Warehouse → Analytics
     ↓            ↓           ↓            ↓            ↓
  APIs/DBs    Raw Storage   ETL/ELT    Structured    Power BI
  Files       (ADLS/S3)    (Spark)     (Synapse)    (Tableau)
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Ingestion:** Azure Data Factory for batch, Event Hubs for streaming
2. **Storage:** Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Bronze/Silver/Gold layers)
3. **Processing:** Azure Databricks with PySpark
4. **Warehouse:** Azure Synapse Analytics
5. **Analytics:** Power BI for self-service analytics

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Partition data by date and customer segment
- Use auto-scaling clusters
- Implement data lifecycle management
- Cache frequently accessed data

### 2. Data Architecture Patterns
**Tejuu's Architecture Patterns:**

**Medallion Architecture:**
- **Bronze:** Raw data as-is
- **Silver:** Cleaned, validated data
- **Gold:** Business-ready aggregations

**Lambda Architecture:**
- **Batch Layer:** Historical data processing
- **Speed Layer:** Real-time data processing
- **Serving Layer:** Combined results

**Kappa Architecture:**
- Single stream processing pipeline
- All data treated as streams
- Simpler than Lambda but less flexible

## Behavioral Interview Questions

### 1. Problem-Solving Examples
**Tejuu's STAR Method Responses:**

**Situation:** At Central Bank of Missouri, we had a data migration project where 12M+ records needed to be moved from Excel/Access to Azure SQL.

**Task:** I was responsible for designing and implementing the migration strategy while ensuring zero data loss and minimal business disruption.

**Action:** 
- Created a comprehensive data mapping document
- Built automated validation scripts to check data quality
- Implemented a phased migration approach with rollback capabilities
- Set up monitoring and alerting for the migration process

**Result:** Successfully migrated all 12M records with 99.9% data accuracy, reduced migration time from 6 months to 2 months, and enabled self-service analytics for 1K+ users.

### 2. Leadership and Collaboration
**Tejuu's Leadership Examples:**

**Cross-functional Collaboration:**
"I worked closely with business users, compliance teams, and IT infrastructure teams to understand requirements and ensure the data platform met all regulatory and business needs. I conducted training sessions for business users on Power BI and created documentation for self-service analytics."
