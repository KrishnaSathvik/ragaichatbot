# Data Lake Modernization Project - Central Bank of Missouri

## Project Overview

**Duration:** Dec 2024 â€“ Present  
**Role:** Senior Analytics Engineer  
**Company:** Central Bank of Missouri  
**Project:** Data Lake Modernization with Microsoft Fabric and dbt

## Technical Challenge

Central Bank had 12M+ records scattered across Excel spreadsheets, Access databases, and legacy systems, making it impossible to get a unified view of customer data, transactions, and risk metrics. The challenge was modernizing this fragmented data landscape into a modern, cloud-based data platform while ensuring compliance, security, and enabling self-service analytics for business users.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the Senior Analytics Engineer, I led the data modernization initiative:
- Designed the overall data architecture using Microsoft Fabric
- Implemented dbt for data transformation and modeling
- Built semantic layers for business user consumption
- Established data governance and quality frameworks
- Created self-service analytics capabilities
- Mentored junior analysts and established best practices

## Key Technical Achievements

### Microsoft Fabric Implementation
I implemented Microsoft Fabric as our unified data platform:
- **OneLake**: Centralized data lake for all business data
- **Data Factory**: Automated data pipelines and ETL processes
- **Synapse**: Data warehousing and analytics
- **dbt Integration**: Data transformation and modeling using dbt
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and reports

### dbt Data Modeling
I established dbt as our primary data transformation tool:
- **Data Models**: Created 50+ dbt models covering all business areas
- **Semantic Layer**: Built semantic models for business user consumption
- **Data Quality**: Implemented dbt tests for data validation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and lineage tracking
- **Version Control**: Git-based development workflow

### Data Architecture Design
I designed a modern data architecture:
- **Ingestion Layer**: Automated data ingestion from various sources
- **Processing Layer**: dbt-based data transformation and modeling
- **Serving Layer**: Semantic models and Power BI datasets
- **Governance Layer**: Data quality, security, and compliance

### Self-Service Analytics Platform
I built a comprehensive self-service analytics platform:
- **Semantic Models**: Business-friendly data models with proper naming and documentation
- **Power BI Datasets**: Pre-built datasets for common business use cases
- **Training Materials**: Comprehensive documentation and training resources
- **Support Structure**: Help desk and user support processes

## Technical Impact

- **Data Volume**: Successfully migrated 12M+ records from legacy systems
- **Performance**: Improved query performance by 60% through optimized data models
- **Cost Optimization**: Achieved 40% cost reduction through efficient resource utilization
- **Data Quality**: Achieved 99.8% data accuracy through automated validation
- **User Adoption**: 95% of business users actively using self-service analytics
- **Development Speed**: Reduced time to create new reports from weeks to days

## Technical Implementation Details

**Microsoft Fabric Components:**
- **OneLake**: Centralized data lake with Delta Lake format
- **Data Factory**: Automated data pipelines with monitoring and alerting
- **Synapse**: Data warehousing with serverless and provisioned compute
- **dbt Cloud**: Data transformation and modeling platform
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and reports

**dbt Implementation:**
- **Models**: 50+ dbt models with proper naming conventions
- **Tests**: Comprehensive data quality tests and validation
- **Documentation**: Automated documentation generation
- **Lineage**: Complete data lineage tracking
- **Version Control**: Git-based development workflow

**Data Quality Framework:**
- **Schema Validation**: Automated schema evolution and validation
- **Data Profiling**: Automated data profiling and anomaly detection
- **Reconciliation**: Automated reconciliation processes
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for data quality issues

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Migrating data from multiple legacy systems with different formats
**Solution**: Created a flexible ingestion framework that could handle various data formats and structures

**Challenge**: Ensuring data quality during migration
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive validation framework with automated testing and monitoring

**Challenge**: Enabling self-service analytics for non-technical users
**Solution**: Built semantic models with business-friendly naming and comprehensive documentation

**Challenge**: Managing data governance and security
**Solution**: Implemented row-level security and established data governance policies

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of building user-centric data solutions. The technical implementation was only part of the success - the real challenge was making data accessible and useful for business users.

The key to success was spending time understanding business requirements and building solutions that addressed real business needs rather than just technical requirements.

## Technical Skills Developed

- **Microsoft Fabric**: OneLake, Data Factory, Synapse, Power BI
- **dbt**: Data modeling, testing, documentation, lineage
- **SQL**: Advanced queries, window functions, CTEs
- **Data Architecture**: Modern data platform design, data modeling
- **Data Quality**: Validation frameworks, monitoring, reconciliation
- **Self-Service Analytics**: Semantic modeling, user training, documentation
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, deployment automation

## Future Plans

- Expand self-service capabilities with more advanced analytics features
