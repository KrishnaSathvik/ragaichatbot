# Semantic Layer Implementation - Central Bank Data Platform

## Semantic Layer Components
- **Naming conventions**: Consistent across all 200+ models
- **KPI contracts**: 45 standardized business metrics
- **Source freshness tests**: 99.8% data freshness compliance
- **dbt docs + exposures**: 15 self-service business exposures

## Naming Convention Standards
- **Tables**: `{domain}_{entity}_{granularity}` (e.g., `finance_transactions_daily`)
- **Columns**: `{entity}_{attribute}` (e.g., `customer_id`, `transaction_amount`)
- **Models**: `{type}_{domain}_{entity}` (e.g., `dim_customer`, `fact_transactions`)
- **Tests**: `{test_type}_{column}` (e.g., `not_null_customer_id`)

## KPI Contracts Implementation
- **Revenue metrics**: 12 standardized revenue calculations
- **Customer metrics**: 8 customer lifecycle KPIs
- **Risk metrics**: 15 risk assessment indicators
- **Operational metrics**: 10 operational efficiency measures

## Data Quality Framework
- **Source freshness**: 99.8% compliance (target: 99%)
- **Test coverage**: 95% of columns have quality tests
- **Data lineage**: 100% of models have documented lineage
- **Change impact**: Automated impact analysis for model changes

## Self-Service Analytics
- **Business exposures**: 15 curated views for business users
- **Documentation**: 200+ models documented with descriptions
- **Data dictionary**: 500+ columns with business definitions
- **Usage tracking**: Monitor which exposures are most used

## Performance Metrics

- **Support tickets**: 70% reduction in data-related support tickets
- **User training**: 2 hours vs 8 hours for new users

## Key Learnings
The naming conventions were crucial for consistency across the team. The KPI contracts eliminated confusion about metric definitions. The self-service exposures reduced the load on the analytics team by 70%. The key was making the semantic layer intuitive for business users while maintaining technical rigor.
