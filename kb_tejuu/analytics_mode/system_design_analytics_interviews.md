# Analytics Engineering System Design Interview Guide - Tejuu's Approach

## Introduction
**Tejuu's Analytics Engineering Philosophy:**
Having built modern data stacks at Central Bank and Stryker, I approach analytics system design by focusing on scalability, maintainability, and business value. My experience with dbt, Snowflake, and data modeling gives me practical insights into building analytics systems that serve both technical and business users effectively.

## Core Analytics Engineering Design Principles

### 1. Modern Data Stack Architecture
**Tejuu's Architecture Approach:**
- **ELT over ETL**: Load raw data first, transform in the warehouse
- **Data Modeling**: Dimensional modeling with star/snowflake schemas
- **Metrics Layer**: Centralized metric definitions and calculations
- **Self-Service**: Enable business users to access data independently

**Example Modern Data Stack:**
```
Data Sources → Ingestion → Data Warehouse → Transformation → Metrics Layer → BI Tools
     ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓            ↓
  APIs/DBs/   Fivetran/    Snowflake/     dbt Models    dbt Metrics   Power BI/
  Files/      Airbyte/     BigQuery/      (SQL)         (YAML)        Tableau/
  Streams     Stitch       Redshift       (Jinja)       (Semantic)    Looker
```

### 2. Data Modeling Best Practices
**Tejuu's Modeling Approach:**
- **Staging Layer**: Clean and standardize raw data
- **Intermediate Layer**: Business logic and transformations
- **Marts Layer**: Business-ready datasets for specific use cases
- **Metrics Layer**: Centralized metric definitions

    )
}}

WITH source AS (
    SELECT * FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
),

renamed AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        TRIM(LOWER(email)) AS email,
        TRIM(first_name) AS first_name,
        TRIM(last_name) AS last_name,
        CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
        phone,
        address,
        city,
        state,
        zip_code,
        country,
        created_at,
        updated_at
    FROM source
    WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT * FROM renamed
```

```sql
-- models/marts/finance/fct_revenue.sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        unique_key='order_id',
        schema='finance'
    )
}}

WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT * FROM {{ ref('int_customer_orders') }}
),

revenue_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        customer_id,
        order_date,
        order_amount,
        
        -- Time dimensions
        DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS order_month,
        DATE_TRUNC('quarter', order_date) AS order_quarter,
        DATE_TRUNC('year', order_date) AS order_year,
        
        -- Customer metrics
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id 
            ORDER BY order_date
        ) AS customer_order_number,
        
        -- Revenue metrics
        SUM(order_amount) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id 
            ORDER BY order_date
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS customer_lifetime_value,
        
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS dbt_updated_at
        
    FROM customer_orders
    WHERE order_status = 'completed'
    
    {% if is_incremental() %}
        AND order_date > (SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM {{ this }})
    {% endif %}
)

SELECT * FROM revenue_metrics
```

### Question 2: Design a Metrics Layer

**Tejuu's Approach:**

**Requirements:**
- Centralized metric definitions
- Consistent calculations across tools
- Version control and lineage
- Self-service metric discovery

**Architecture:**
```
dbt Models → dbt Metrics → Semantic Layer → BI Tools
     ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓
  Raw Data   Metric        Metric        Power BI/
  (Tables)   Definitions   API           Tableau/
             (YAML)       (GraphQL)      Looker
```

**dbt Metrics Implementation:**
```yaml
# metrics/revenue_metrics.yml
version: 2

metrics:
  - name: total_revenue
    label: Total Revenue
    model: ref('fct_revenue')
    description: Sum of all completed order amounts
    
    calculation_method: sum
    expression: order_amount
    
    timestamp: order_date
    time_grains: [day, week, month, quarter, year]
    
    dimensions:
      - customer_segment
      - product_category
      - region
    
    filters:
      - field: order_status
        operator: '='
        value: "'completed'"

  - name: average_order_value
    label: Average Order Value
    model: ref('fct_revenue')
    description: Average amount per order
    
    calculation_method: average
    expression: order_amount
    
    timestamp: order_date
    time_grains: [day, week, month, quarter, year]

  - name: customer_lifetime_value
    label: Customer Lifetime Value
    model: ref('dim_customers')
    description: Total revenue per customer
    
    calculation_method: sum
    expression: total_spent
    
    dimensions:
      - customer_segment

  dbt Models    dbt Tests      Grafana    PagerDuty   Auto-fix/
  (SQL)         (YAML)         Dashboards Notifications Manual
                               (DataDog)  (Slack)     Review
```

**dbt Tests Implementation:**
```yaml
# models/staging/schema.yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_customers
    description: Cleaned and standardized customer data
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key for customers
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      
      - name: email
        description: Customer email address
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
          - dbt_utils.email
      
      - name: created_at
        description: Timestamp when customer was created
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= '2020-01-01'"

  - name: stg_orders
    description: Cleaned and standardized order data
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_customers')
              field: customer_id
      
      - name: order_amount
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: "> 0"
```

**Custom Tests:**
```sql
-- tests/assert_revenue_positive.sql
SELECT
    order_id,
    order_amount
FROM {{ ref('fct_revenue') }}
WHERE order_amount <= 0
```
