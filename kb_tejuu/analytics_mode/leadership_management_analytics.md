# Analytics Engineering Leadership & Management Guide - Tejuu's Approach

## Introduction
**Tejuu's Leadership Philosophy:**
Having led analytics teams at Central Bank and Stryker, I approach leadership by focusing on data-driven decision making, team development, and business impact. My experience spans technical leadership, cross-functional collaboration, and strategic planning in analytics organizations.

## Core Leadership Competencies

### 1. Technical Leadership
**Tejuu's Technical Leadership Examples:**

#### Example 1: Leading Analytics Team Through dbt Migration
**Situation:** At Central Bank, I was tasked with leading a 4-person analytics team to migrate from legacy ETL processes to a modern dbt-based data stack while maintaining business continuity.

**Task:** I needed to ensure technical excellence, maintain team productivity, and deliver the project on time while building team capabilities.

**Action:**
- Established dbt coding standards and best practices
- Created detailed technical documentation and architecture diagrams
- Implemented agile development practices with daily standups
- Conducted weekly technical deep-dives and knowledge sharing sessions
- Established clear escalation paths and decision-making processes
- Created reusable macros and frameworks for common patterns

**Result:** Successfully migrated 47 models to dbt, reducing data transformation time from 45 minutes to 8 minutes (82% improvement). Team productivity increased by 60%, and we established technical standards that became the foundation for future analytics projects.

#### Example 2: Technical Decision Making
**Situation:** During the Central Bank project, we faced a critical decision between using Snowflake vs. BigQuery for our data warehouse, with significant cost and performance implications.

**Task:** I needed to make a data-driven decision that balanced performance, cost, and team expertise while considering long-term scalability.

**Action:**
- Conducted comprehensive evaluation with POC on both platforms

- Consulted with team members about their preferences and expertise
- Created detailed cost projections for different usage scenarios
- Presented findings to stakeholders with clear recommendations
- Implemented chosen solution with migration plan

**Result:** Chose Snowflake based on team expertise and cost-effectiveness. Achieved 40% cost reduction compared to BigQuery while maintaining query performance. Team adoption was smooth due to existing expertise, and we established Snowflake as the standard platform.

### 2. Team Development & Mentoring
**Tejuu's Team Development Examples:**

#### Example 1: Building Analytics Team Capabilities
**Situation:** When I joined Central Bank, the analytics team had limited experience with modern data stack tools like dbt and cloud data warehouses.

**Task:** I needed to quickly upskill the team while maintaining project momentum and ensuring code quality.

**Action:**
- Created personalized learning plans for each team member
- Implemented pair programming sessions for complex models
- Established code review process with detailed feedback
- Shared best practices and common pitfalls
- Involved team members in architecture decisions and discussions
- Provided opportunities to present work to stakeholders

**Result:** Team became productive within 4 weeks and contributed to major features. Two team members were promoted to senior roles within 1 year. The team established a culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing.

#### Example 2: Managing Cross-Functional Collaboration
**Situation:** I needed to coordinate with business users, data engineers, and IT teams to implement a self-service analytics platform.

**Task:** I needed to ensure seamless collaboration while building team capabilities and maintaining project momentum.

**Action:**
- Established regular cross-functional meetings with clear agendas
- Created shared documentation and decision logs
- Implemented feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Conducted training sessions for different stakeholder groups
- Established clear communication channels and escalation procedures
- Created success metrics and regular progress reviews

**Result:** Successfully delivered self-service analytics platform with 75% user adoption. Cross-functional collaboration improved significantly, and we established sustainable processes for future projects.

### 3. Strategic Planning & Vision
**Tejuu's Strategic Leadership Examples:**

#### Example 1: Analytics Strategy Development
**Situation:** At Central Bank, I was asked to develop a 2-year analytics strategy that would align with business objectives and drive data-driven decision making.

**Task:** I needed to create a comprehensive analytics strategy that would guide technology decisions, resource allocation, and team development.

**Action:**
- Conducted comprehensive analysis of current analytics capabilities and gaps
- Interviewed stakeholders across different business units
- Researched industry trends and best practices
- Created technology roadmap with specific milestones
- Defined success metrics and KPIs for analytics initiatives
- Presented strategy to executive leadership with clear recommendations

**Result:** Strategy was approved and implemented, leading to 5 new analytics initiatives and $1.5M additional budget. The strategy became the foundation for analytics decision-making and helped align technology investments with business objectives.

#### Example 2: Data Governance Framework
**Situation:** I needed to create a data governance framework that would ensure data quality, security, and compliance while enabling self-service analytics.

**Task:** I needed to balance data governance requirements with user needs while considering compliance and security requirements.

**Action:**
- Analyzed current data governance practices and identified gaps
- Consulted with compliance, security, and business teams
- Created comprehensive data governance framework
- Implemented data classification and access control
- Established data quality monitoring and reporting
- Created training and awareness programs

**Result:** Framework was successfully implemented, improving data quality by 40% and reducing compliance issues by 90%. The framework became the standard for data governance across the organization.

### 4. Cross-Functional Collaboration
**Tejuu's Collaboration Examples:**

#### Example 1: Working with Business Stakeholders
**Situation:** The finance team at Central Bank needed a new revenue reporting system, but they had specific requirements that conflicted with our technical architecture.

**Task:** I needed to find a solution that met business requirements while maintaining technical best practices and system performance.

**Action:**
- Scheduled regular meetings with finance team to understand requirements
- Created mock-ups and prototypes to validate approach
- Proposed phased implementation to manage complexity
- Involved finance team in testing and validation process
- Created comprehensive documentation and training materials
- Established ongoing support and maintenance process

**Result:** Successfully delivered revenue reporting system that met all business requirements. Finance team satisfaction increased from 3.2/5.0 to 4.5/5.0, and the system became a template for other business reporting needs.

#### Example 2: Coordinating with Data Engineering Team
**Situation:** Our analytics team needed real-time data from the data engineering team, but they were focused on batch processing and had concerns about performance impact.

**Task:** I needed to work with the data engineering team to implement real-time data capabilities while addressing their performance concerns.

**Action:**
- Organized joint planning sessions with data engineering team
- Created technical feasibility analysis for real-time requirements
- Proposed incremental approach starting with near-real-time (15-minute delay)
- Implemented monitoring to track performance impact
- Established clear SLAs and escalation procedures
- Created shared documentation and runbooks

**Result:** Successfully implemented near-real-time data pipeline with 15-minute delay. Data engineering team was satisfied with performance impact (less than 5% increase in resource usage). Analytics team gained access to fresher data, improving report accuracy.
