# Delta Live Tables - Tejuu Experience

## Overview
Delta Live Tables (DLT) is Databricks' declarative framework for building reliable, maintainable, and testable data processing pipelines. It provides automatic data quality management, schema evolution, and pipeline orchestration.

## Tejuu's Experience with Delta Live Tables

### Implementation at Stryker
At Stryker, I implemented Delta Live Tables as part of our data modernization initiative to replace legacy ETL processes. The main challenge was migrating from traditional batch processing to a more modern, streaming-capable architecture.

### Key Challenges Faced

1. **Learning Curve**: The team had to learn the DLT syntax and concepts, which was different from traditional PySpark development
2. **Migration Complexity**: Converting existing PySpark notebooks to DLT format required significant refactoring
3. **Testing and Validation**: Ensuring data quality and correctness during the migration process
4. **Performance Tuning**: Optimizing DLT pipelines for large-scale data processing

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Incremental Migration**: Started with smaller, less critical datasets to build team expertise
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implemented data quality expectations and validation rules
3. **Documentation**: Created detailed documentation and best practices for the team
4. **Monitoring**: Set up proper monitoring and alerting for DLT pipeline health

### Technical Implementation

```python
# Example DLT pipeline for customer data processing
@dlt.table(
    comment="Cleaned customer data with deduplication",
    table_properties={
        "quality": "gold"
    }
)
@dlt.expect("valid_customer_id", "customer_id IS NOT NULL")
@dlt.expect("valid_email", "email IS NOT NULL AND email LIKE '%@%'")
def customer_clean():
    return (
        spark.readStream
        .table("bronze.customers")
        .withColumn("processed_at", current_timestamp())
        .dropDuplicates(["customer_id"])
    )
```

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Data Quality**: Automatic data quality management with built-in expectations
2. **Schema Evolution**: Automatic handling of schema changes without breaking pipelines
3. **Reliability**: Built-in retry logic and error handling
4. **Maintainability**: Declarative approach made pipelines easier to understand and maintain

### Lessons Learned

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple use cases to build team confidence
2. **Invest in Training**: Proper team training is crucial for successful adoption
3. **Monitor Closely**: DLT pipelines require different monitoring approaches than traditional ETL
4. **Plan for Migration**: Allow sufficient time for testing and validation during migration

### Current Status
Successfully migrated 80% of our critical data pipelines to DLT, resulting in 30% reduction in data processing time and improved data quality metrics.
