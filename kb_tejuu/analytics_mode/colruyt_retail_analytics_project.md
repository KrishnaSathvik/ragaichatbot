# Retail Analytics Platform - Colruyt IT Group

## Project Overview

**Duration:** May 2018 – Dec 2019  
**Role:** Data Analyst  
**Company:** Colruyt IT Group  
**Project:** Retail Analytics & Merchandising Intelligence Platform

## Technical Challenge

Colruyt IT Group had fragmented reporting processes across multiple retail locations and departments. Each department was using different Excel files and Access databases to track financial performance, merchandising metrics, and operational data. The challenge was consolidating these disparate data sources into a unified analytics platform that could provide real-time insights for business decision-making and accelerate month-end close cycles.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the Data Analyst, I was responsible for:
- Consolidating fragmented Excel and Access reporting processes
- Creating standardized Power BI dashboards with reusable DAX templates
- Designing SQL dimensional models for finance and merchandising analyses
- Building automated data pipelines for real-time reporting
- Training users on new analytics tools and processes

## Key Technical Achievements

### Data Consolidation & Standardization
I consolidated fragmented Excel and Access reporting processes into standardized Power BI dashboards with reusable DAX templates. This eliminated data duplication and increased trust in weekly financial and merchandising performance metrics.

**What I accomplished:**
- Consolidated 50+ different Excel files into unified dashboards
- Created 20+ reusable DAX templates for common calculations
- Reduced data duplication by 60% across all departments
- Improved data accuracy and consistency significantly

### SQL Dimensional Modeling
I designed SQL dimensional models to support finance and merchandising analyses. This accelerated month-end close cycles, provided interactive drilldowns, and replaced time-consuming manual spreadsheet-based efforts.

**Technical implementations:**
- Built star schema data models for retail analytics
- Created fact tables for sales, inventory, and customer data
- Designed dimension tables for products, stores, time, and customers
- Implemented automated data refresh processes

### Power BI Dashboard Development
I created interactive Power BI dashboards that provided real-time visibility into retail operations, financial performance, and merchandising metrics. The dashboards were designed for different user groups and business functions.

**Dashboard categories:**
- **Financial Dashboards**: Revenue, profit margins, cost analysis
- **Merchandising Dashboards**: Product performance, category analysis, pricing
- **Operational Dashboards**: Store performance, inventory levels, customer metrics
- **Executive Dashboards**: KPI tracking, trend analysis, strategic insights

## Business Impact

### Quantifiable Results
- **Efficiency**: Accelerated month-end close cycles by 40% (5 days → 3 days)
- **Data Quality**: Improved data accuracy by 35% through standardization
- **User Adoption**: Enabled 500+ users with self-service analytics
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced manual reporting effort by 60% (40 hours → 16 hours weekly)
- **Decision Making**: Reduced time to generate reports from days to hours

### Process Improvements
- **Standardized Reporting**: Created consistent reporting processes across all departments
- **Automated Data Refresh**: Implemented daily automated data updates
- **Data Governance**: Established data quality standards and validation processes
- **Training Program**: Developed comprehensive training materials for users

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline Design
```
Legacy Systems (Excel/Access) → SQL Server → Power BI → Business Users
```

### Key Technologies Used
- **Database**: SQL Server, dimensional modeling
