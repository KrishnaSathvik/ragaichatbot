## Business Challenge

Central Bank was struggling with fragmented reporting across different departments. Each team was using different tools (Excel, Access, various BI tools) and there was no single source of truth for business data. The compliance team needed real-time access to regulatory reports, the finance team needed financial dashboards, and the risk team needed portfolio monitoring tools. Manual processes were consuming 60+ hours weekly across teams.
