# Merchandising Intelligence Platform - Colruyt IT Group

## Project Overview

**Duration:** May 2018 – Dec 2019  
**Role:** Business Analyst  
**Company:** Colruyt IT Group  
**Project:** Merchandising Intelligence & Financial Reporting Platform

## Business Challenge

Colruyt IT Group needed to improve their merchandising and financial reporting capabilities across multiple retail locations. The challenge was that different departments were using different systems and processes to track financial performance, merchandising metrics, and operational data. The finance team was spending 40+ hours weekly on manual data reconciliation and report generation, while the merchandising team lacked visibility into product performance and category trends.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the Business Analyst, I was responsible for:
- Working with store managers and regional directors to understand reporting needs
- Creating solutions to improve operational efficiency
- Consolidating fragmented Excel and Access reporting processes
- Building standardized Power BI dashboards with reusable DAX templates
- Training users on new reporting tools and processes

## Key Business Achievements

### Merchandising Analytics Dashboard
