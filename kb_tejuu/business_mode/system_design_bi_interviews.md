# Business Intelligence System Design Interview Guide - Tejuu's Approach

## Introduction
**Tejuu's BI System Design Philosophy:**
Having built enterprise BI solutions at Central Bank and Stryker, I approach BI system design by focusing on user experience, data governance, and business value. My experience with Power BI, Tableau, and stakeholder management gives me practical insights into building BI systems that drive business decisions and user adoption.

## Core BI System Design Principles

### 1. User-Centric Design
**Tejuu's User-Centric Approach:**
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Different views for different user types
- **Self-Service Analytics**: Enable business users to explore data independently
- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile and desktop usage
- **Performance**: Sub-3 second load times for all dashboards

**Example BI Architecture:**
```
Data Sources → Data Warehouse → Semantic Layer → BI Tools → Users
     ↓           ↓              ↓              ↓         ↓
  Multiple    Snowflake/      dbt Models     Power BI/  Executives/
  Sources     BigQuery/       (Metrics)      Tableau/   Managers/
  (APIs/      Redshift        (Semantic)     Looker     Analysts/
  DBs/Files)  (Partitioned)   (Governance)   (Mobile)   End Users
```

### 2. Data Governance & Security
**Tejuu's Governance Approach:**
- **Row-Level Security**: Filter data based on user attributes
- **Data Classification**: Tier data by sensitivity and usage
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and approvals
- **Audit Logging**: Track all data access and modifications

## Common BI System Design Questions

    CALCULATE(
        [Total Revenue],
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])
    )
RETURN
DIVIDE(
    CurrentYear - PreviousYear,
    PreviousYear,
    0
)

-- Customer Segmentation
Customer Segment = 
VAR CustomerLTV = [Customer Lifetime Value]
RETURN
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    CustomerLTV >= 10000, "VIP",
    CustomerLTV >= 5000, "Gold",
    CustomerLTV >= 1000, "Silver",
    "Bronze"
)
```

### Question 2: Design a Real-Time Dashboard System

**Tejuu's Approach:**

**Requirements:**
- Real-time data updates (<30 seconds)
- 1000+ concurrent users
- Mobile and desktop access
- High availability (99.9% uptime)

**Architecture:**
```
Data Sources → Stream Processing → Data Lake → Real-Time Analytics → Dashboard
     ↓             ↓                ↓            ↓                  ↓
  IoT/APIs/    Kafka/Event      Delta Lake    Power BI          Mobile/
  Databases    Hubs/            (Streaming)   Real-Time         Desktop

[Region Access] = 
VAR UserRegion = USERNAME()
RETURN
SWITCH(
    UserRegion,
    "east@company.com", Sales[Region] = "East",
    "west@company.com", Sales[Region] = "West",
    "central@company.com", Sales[Region] = "Central",
    FALSE()

## Tejuu's Interview Tips

### 1. Start with Business Context
- Understand the business use case and user personas
- Ask about data volume, user count, and performance requirements
- Clarify compliance and security requirements

### 2. Think in Layers
- Start with high-level architecture, then drill down
- Consider data flow, storage, processing, and presentation layers
- Think about monitoring, security, and operational concerns

### 3. Use Real Examples
- Reference actual systems I've built at Central Bank and Stryker
- Share specific metrics and performance improvements
- Discuss real challenges and how I solved them

### 4. Consider Trade-offs
- Always discuss trade-offs between different approaches
- Explain why I chose specific technologies or patterns
- Be honest about limitations and potential improvements

This system design approach has helped me successfully design and deploy BI platforms that serve hundreds of users while maintaining high performance and user satisfaction.
