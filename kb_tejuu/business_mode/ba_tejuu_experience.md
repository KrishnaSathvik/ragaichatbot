## Professional Experience

### Senior Business Analyst — Central Bank of Missouri
**Duration:** Dec 2024 – Present

**Key Responsibilities and Achievements:**

At Central Bank of Missouri, I'm currently leading a major initiative to transform how our business teams access and use data for decision-making. The challenge was that different departments were using different Excel files and reports, making it impossible to get a unified view of our business performance. I worked closely with stakeholders across finance, audit, and risk teams to understand their specific reporting needs and pain points.

What I did was conduct comprehensive stakeholder interviews to map out all the different reporting requirements. I documented over 50 different business processes and identified the key metrics that each team needed to track. This was crucial because it helped me design dashboards that actually addressed real business needs rather than just technical requirements.

I built interactive Power BI dashboards that provide real-time visibility into key business metrics. The finance team can now track revenue trends, the audit team has access to compliance dashboards, and the risk team can monitor portfolio performance - all from a single platform. This eliminated the need for multiple Excel files and reduced reporting time by 25%.

One of my biggest wins was implementing a self-service analytics program. I trained over 200 business users on how to create their own reports and dashboards using Power BI. This reduced the dependency on IT for every small report request and empowered business users to make data-driven decisions independently. We saw a 30% reduction in ad-hoc reporting requests and significantly improved user satisfaction.

I also established a structured process for gathering new reporting requirements. I created templates for business users to submit requests, implemented a review process with stakeholders, and developed documentation standards. This has improved collaboration between business and IT teams and reduced project delivery time by 40%.

**Technologies Used:**
- Power BI, DAX, Power Query
- SQL, Python
- Azure SQL, Azure Data Factory
- Excel, Access migration
- Git for version control

### Business Analyst — Stryker
**Duration:** Jan 2022 – Dec 2024

**Key Responsibilities and Achievements:**

At Stryker, I worked as a Business Analyst supporting global sales and service operations. My main focus was on improving how our sales teams and executives access and use data to make better business decisions. I spent a lot of time working with stakeholders across different regions to understand their specific reporting needs and challenges.

I conducted extensive stakeholder interviews with sales managers, regional directors, and executives to map out their reporting requirements. I documented over 50 different business processes and identified the key performance indicators that each team needed to track. This was really important because it helped me understand the business context behind the data requests.

I designed and built Power BI dashboards that provided real-time visibility into sales performance, customer satisfaction, and service metrics. The sales managers could now track their team's performance, regional directors could compare performance across territories, and executives could get high-level insights into overall business health. These dashboards were used by over 500 field reps and managers worldwide.

One of my key responsibilities was ensuring that the reports I created actually addressed real business needs. I worked closely with end users to gather feedback, iterate on dashboard designs, and provide training on how to use the new reporting tools. This user-centric approach resulted in high adoption rates and positive feedback from business stakeholders.

I consolidated fragmented Excel and Access reporting processes into standardized Power BI dashboards with reusable DAX templates. This reduced duplication and increased trust in weekly financial and merchandising performance metrics.

I designed SQL dimensional models to support finance and merchandising analyses. This accelerated month-end close cycles, provided interactive drilldowns, and replaced time-consuming manual spreadsheet-based efforts.

## Interview Talking Points

### Problem-Solving Examples

**Challenge: Legacy System Migration**
At Central Bank of Missouri, we had this huge challenge where all the reporting was in Excel files and Access databases. The data was inconsistent, reports were breaking, and analysts were spending hours manually reconciling numbers. What I did was work with stakeholders to understand their requirements, then design a migration strategy to move everything to Azure SQL and Power BI. I wrote validation scripts and we reconciled over 12 million records. The result was that we reduced manual work by 40% and improved data accuracy significantly.

**Challenge: Stakeholder Alignment**
One challenge I faced at Central Bank was getting buy-in from different departments for the migration project. Finance wanted things one way, audit had different requirements, and risk had their own needs. What I did was organize workshops with each group, documented their requirements, and found common ground. I created a standardized KPI framework that met everyone's needs. The result was successful adoption across all departments and a 30% reduction in ad-hoc reporting requests.

**Challenge: Self-Service Analytics**
At Stryker, we had this challenge where business users were constantly requesting reports from IT, creating bottlenecks and delays. I designed and implemented a self-service analytics platform using Power BI. I created standardized data models, trained users, and built a governance framework. The result was that we reduced report development time by 60% and increased user satisfaction significantly.

### Technical Strengths

**Power BI & DAX**
I'm really strong in Power BI and DAX. I've built over 50 dashboards across different business functions. I know how to optimize DAX formulas for performance, implement RLS for security, and design semantic models that are easy for business users to understand.

**Requirements Gathering & Analysis**
I'm excellent at working with stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into technical requirements. I know how to conduct interviews, document user stories, and ensure that solutions meet business objectives.

**Data Analysis & Visualization**
I'm skilled at analyzing data to identify trends and patterns, then creating compelling visualizations that tell a story. I know how to choose the right chart types, use color effectively, and design dashboards that drive action.

**Stakeholder Management**
I'm good at working with non-technical stakeholders. I can translate technical concepts into business terms and explain complex data in simple language. I've worked with executives, finance teams, operations, and IT across multiple companies.

## Work Style & Approach

### My Philosophy
I believe in building solutions that truly meet business needs. When I design a dashboard or report, I think about the end user and how they'll use it to make decisions. I don't just deliver a solution - I make sure it solves the real business problem.

### Collaboration
I work well in cross-functional teams. I've collaborated with data engineers, software developers, business users, and executives. I believe in clear communication, documentation, and knowledge sharing.

### Continuous Learning
I'm always learning new tools and techniques. I recently learned advanced DAX patterns and have been exploring more Power BI features. I believe in staying current with industry trends and best practices.

### Problem-Solving Approach
When I face a problem, I start by understanding the business context and stakeholder needs. I gather requirements, analyze the data, and design a solution that addresses the root cause. I believe in iterative development - start with an MVP, get feedback, and improve. I also believe in testing thoroughly and getting user acceptance before deployment.
