**Role:** Data Analyst  
**Company:** CVS Health  
**Project:** Inventory Management & Pharmacy Operations Analytics

## Business Challenge

CVS Health was struggling with inventory management across 9,000+ stores nationwide. Each store was using different systems and processes to track inventory, leading to stockouts, overstock situations, and inefficient ordering processes. The pharmacy team needed better visibility into prescription trends, inventory levels, and customer demand patterns to optimize operations and reduce costs.
