# Power BI Governance Framework - Central Bank Implementation

## Governance Structure
- **RLS roles**: 8 roles (finance_manager, auditor, analyst, executive, etc.)
- **Certified datasets**: 25 production datasets with approval workflow
- **Lineage views**: 100% of reports have documented data lineage
- **Deployment pipelines**: 3 environments (dev, test, prod) with automated promotion

## Row-Level Security (RLS) Implementation
- **Finance Manager**: Access to all financial data, can see all customers
- **Auditor**: Read-only access to all data, can export for audit purposes
- **Analyst**: Access to non-sensitive data, can create personal reports
- **Executive**: High-level dashboards only, no detailed data access

## Certified Dataset Process
1. **Development**: Create dataset in dev environment
2. **Testing**: Validate data quality and performance
3. **Review**: Business stakeholder approval required
4. **Certification**: IT team certifies for production use
5. **Monitoring**: Ongoing performance and usage monitoring

## Data Lineage and Documentation
- **Source tracking**: Every measure traces back to source system
- **Transformation logic**: Documented in dbt models and Power Query
- **Refresh schedule**: Documented for each dataset
- **Dependencies**: Mapped all report dependencies

## Deployment Pipeline
- **Development**: Developers work in dev environment
- **Testing**: Automated tests + manual validation in test
- **Production**: Automated deployment with approval gates
- **Rollback**: Quick rollback capability for issues

## Performance Monitoring
- **Dataset refresh**: 99.5% success rate (target: 99%)
- **Query performance**: 90% of queries < 3 seconds
- **User satisfaction**: 4.2/5.0 (up from 3.1/5.0)
- **Adoption rate**: 85% of users actively using Power BI

## Security and Compliance
- **Data classification**: 100% of data classified by sensitivity
- **Access logging**: Complete audit trail of data access
- **Compliance reporting**: Automated reports for regulatory requirements
- **Data retention**: Automated archiving after 7 years

## Cost Management
- **Premium capacity**: Right-sized based on actual usage
- **Storage optimization**: Compress old reports, archive unused content
- **User licensing**: Optimized license allocation based on usage
- **Total cost**: $15,000/month (25% reduction from initial setup)

## Key Learnings
The RLS implementation was crucial for data security - we have 8 different roles with specific access patterns. The certified dataset process eliminated data quality issues. The deployment pipeline with approval gates prevented many production issues. The key was making governance processes that developers could follow without slowing down development.
