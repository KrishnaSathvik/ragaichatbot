# Medicaid Claims Analytics Project - Stryker

## Project Overview

**Duration:** Jan 2022 â€“ Dec 2024  
**Role:** Business Analyst  
**Company:** Stryker  
**Project:** Medicaid Claims Analytics & Regulatory Reporting

## Business Challenge

Stryker needed to improve their Medicaid claims processing and regulatory reporting capabilities. The challenge was that different regions were using different systems and processes to track Medicaid claims, making it difficult to ensure compliance and get accurate reporting for regulatory submissions. The finance and compliance teams were spending 40+ hours monthly on manual data reconciliation and report generation.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the Business Analyst, I was responsible for:
- Gathering requirements from compliance, finance, and regional teams
- Designing reporting solutions that met regulatory standards
- Creating dashboards for claims tracking and compliance monitoring
- Training users on new reporting tools and processes
- Ensuring data accuracy and compliance with Medicaid regulations

## Key Achievements

### Stakeholder Requirements Gathering
I conducted extensive interviews with compliance officers, finance managers, and regional directors across 12 different states to understand their specific Medicaid reporting requirements. I documented over 30 different compliance requirements and created a unified reporting framework that satisfied all regional needs.

### Power BI Dashboard Development
I designed and built comprehensive Power BI dashboards that provided real-time visibility into:
- **Claims Processing Status**: Track pending, approved, and denied claims by region
- **Compliance Metrics**: Monitor adherence to Medicaid regulations and deadlines
- **Financial Impact**: Track revenue impact of claims processing efficiency
- **Regional Performance**: Compare performance across different states and regions

### Regulatory Reporting Automation
I created automated reports that generated the required regulatory submissions for each state's Medicaid program. This included:
- Monthly claims summaries with proper formatting for each state
- Compliance status reports for internal audit purposes
- Financial reconciliation reports for the finance team
- Exception reports highlighting any compliance issues

### User Training & Adoption
I developed training materials and conducted workshops for over 150 users across different departments. This included:
- Dashboard navigation and filtering techniques
- Understanding Medicaid compliance requirements
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Best practices for data entry and validation

## Business Impact

- **Reduced Manual Work**: Cut manual reporting time from 40 hours to 8 hours monthly
- **Improved Compliance**: Achieved 99.5% compliance rate with Medicaid regulations
- **Faster Decision Making**: Reduced time to identify and resolve compliance issues from days to hours
- **Cost Savings**: Eliminated need for external compliance consultants, saving $50K annually
- **User Satisfaction**: 95% user satisfaction rate with new reporting tools

## Technical Implementation

**Tools Used:**
- Power BI for dashboard development
- DAX for complex calculations and measures
- SQL for data extraction and validation
- Excel for initial data analysis and prototyping
- SharePoint for document management and collaboration

**Key Features:**
- Role-based security ensuring users only see relevant data
- Automated data refresh schedules
- Mobile-responsive design for field users
- Export capabilities for regulatory submissions
- Real-time alerts for compliance issues

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Different states had different Medicaid requirements and data formats
**Solution**: Created a flexible data model that could accommodate various state-specific requirements while maintaining consistency

**Challenge**: Users were resistant to change from existing Excel-based processes
**Solution**: Implemented a phased rollout with extensive training and support, starting with power users who could champion the new system

**Challenge**: Ensuring data accuracy and compliance
**Solution**: Built in automated validation checks and created a comprehensive audit trail for all data changes

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me the importance of understanding both technical requirements and business context. Working with compliance teams required a deep understanding of regulatory requirements, while working with regional teams required sensitivity to different operational needs and constraints.

The key to success was spending time upfront to understand the business processes and stakeholder needs before jumping into technical solutions. This user-centric approach resulted in high adoption rates and positive feedback from all stakeholders.
