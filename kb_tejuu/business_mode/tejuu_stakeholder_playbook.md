# Stakeholder Management Playbook - Central Bank BI Team

## Requirements Gathering Process
- **Workshop format**: 2-hour sessions with 8-12 stakeholders
- **Preparation**: Send agenda and questions 48 hours in advance
- **Documentation**: Real-time documentation during sessions
- **Follow-up**: Summary and next steps within 24 hours

## Workshop Structure
1. **Business context** (15 minutes): Current state and pain points
2. **Requirements** (60 minutes): Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Mock-ups** (30 minutes): Visual examples and wireframes
4. **Prioritization** (15 minutes): Rank requirements by importance

## Mock-up and Prototyping Process
- **Low-fidelity**: Paper sketches for initial concepts
- **Medium-fidelity**: Power BI mock-ups with sample data
- **High-fidelity**: Interactive prototypes with real data
- **Iteration cycles**: 3 rounds of feedback and refinement

## UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Framework
- **Test scripts**: 25 standardized test scenarios
- **User training**: 2-hour training session before UAT
- **Feedback collection**: Structured feedback forms and interviews
- **Issue tracking**: Jira tickets for all issues and resolutions

## Training and Adoption Strategy
- **Role-based training**: Different training for different user types
- **Hands-on workshops**: 4-hour workshops with real data
- **Documentation**: Video tutorials and written guides
- **Support**: Dedicated support channel for first 30 days

## Key Learnings
The workshop format was crucial for getting accurate requirements - stakeholders were more engaged in person. The mock-up process saved significant development time by catching issues early. The UAT framework with structured test scripts ensured quality. The key was making the process collaborative rather than just gathering requirements.
