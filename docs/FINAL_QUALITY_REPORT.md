## 📈 **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Metrics Coverage: 70% → 100% (+30%)**

**Problem:** 6 questions lacked quantifiable metrics
- Krishna DE: 2/4 had metrics
- Tejuu BI: 2/4 had metrics
- Tejuu AE: 2/4 had metrics

**Solution:** Enhanced all prompts with explicit CRITICAL metrics requirements:

#### **Krishna DE - Added:**

- Performance improvements (e.g., "40% faster")
- Data volume handled (e.g., "10TB monthly")
- Cost savings (e.g., "$3K/month reduction")
- Latency improvements, throughput increases

#### **Tejuu BI - Added:**
- Dashboard adoption rates (e.g., "85% user adoption")
- Performance improvements (e.g., "load time from 30s to 3s")
- User engagement increases (e.g., "40% more daily users")
- Time-to-insight reductions (e.g., "from 2 days to 2 hours")
- Report usage statistics, satisfaction scores

#### **Tejuu AE - Added:**
- Model build time improvements (e.g., "45 min to 8 min")
- Data quality test coverage (e.g., "95% coverage")
- Data freshness improvements (e.g., "daily to hourly")
- Transformation performance (e.g., "60% faster queries")
- Pipeline reliability metrics (e.g., "99.5% uptime")

**Result:** All 20 questions now include specific, quantifiable metrics! 🎯

## 🎯 **Example Improvements:**

### **Before (Missing Metrics):**
> "At Central Bank of Missouri, my approach to dimensional modeling focuses on understanding business needs first. I work with stakeholders to identify the key metrics and dimensions needed..."

### **After (With Metrics):**
> "At Central Bank of Missouri, my approach to dimensional modeling resulted in query performance improvements of up to 60% faster execution times. For example, when I redesigned our sales reporting star schema, we reduced report generation time from 5 minutes to under 2 minutes..."
