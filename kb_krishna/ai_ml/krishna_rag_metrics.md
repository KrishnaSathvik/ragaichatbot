# RAG System Performance Metrics - Walgreens Implementation

## Baseline Performance (Before Optimization)
- **Hit@3 accuracy**: 0.62 (62% of queries had correct answer in top 3 results)
- **P95 latency**: 3100ms (95th percentile response time)
- **Cache hit rate**: 38% (Redis cache effectiveness)
- **User satisfaction**: 3.2/5.0 (based on feedback surveys)

## Post-Optimization Results (After Hybrid Retrieval)
- **Hit@3 accuracy**: 0.81 (81% of queries had correct answer in top 3 results)
- **P95 latency**: 1700ms (45% improvement in response time)
- **Cache hit rate**: 67% (76% improvement in cache effectiveness)
- **User satisfaction**: 4.1/5.0 (28% improvement in user ratings)

## Key Optimizations Implemented
1. **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combined dense embeddings with sparse BM25 for better coverage
2. **Reranking Pipeline**: Added cross-encoder reranker to improve top-k accuracy
3. **Chunk Overlap**: Increased from 50 to 100 tokens for better context preservation
4. **Query Expansion**: Added synonym expansion and query reformulation
5. **Caching Strategy**: Implemented multi-level caching (query, embedding, response)

## Production Monitoring
- **Daily query volume**: ~15,000 queries
- **Peak concurrent users**: 450
- **Error rate**: <0.1% (99.9% uptime)
- **Cost per query**: $0.003 (reduced from $0.007)

## Lessons Learned
The biggest impact came from the reranking step - it improved accuracy by 19 percentage points while only adding 200ms to latency. The hybrid approach caught edge cases that pure semantic search missed, especially for technical terms and acronyms common in healthcare contexts.
