# RAG Systems Architecture

## Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses.

## Key Components

### 1. Document Ingestion Pipeline
- **Text Chunking**: Split documents into overlapping chunks (typically 512-1024 tokens)
- **Embedding Generation**: Use models like `text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-ada-002`
- **Vector Storage**: Store embeddings in vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS)

### 2. Retrieval Strategy
- **Similarity Search**: Use cosine similarity or dot product for semantic matching
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic search with keyword-based BM25
- **Re-ranking**: Apply cross-encoder models to improve relevance

### 3. Generation Process
- **Context Injection**: Include retrieved chunks in the prompt
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structure prompts to leverage retrieved information
- **Response Synthesis**: Generate answers grounded in retrieved context

## Implementation Best Practices

### Chunking Strategies
- **Fixed-size chunks**: Simple but may split important information
- **Semantic chunking**: Use sentence transformers to find natural boundaries
- **Hierarchical chunking**: Store both fine and coarse-grained representations

### Embedding Models
- **General purpose**: OpenAI embeddings work well for most use cases
- **Domain-specific**: Fine-tune embeddings on your specific domain
- **Multilingual**: Consider models like `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`

### Vector Database Selection
- **Pinecone**: Managed service, good for production
- **Weaviate**: Open source, supports hybrid search
- **FAISS**: Facebook's library, good for research and prototyping
- **Chroma**: Lightweight, easy to get started

## Performance Optimization

### Query Processing
- **Query expansion**: Generate multiple query variations
- **Query routing**: Direct queries to specialized indexes
- **Caching**: Cache frequent queries and their results

### Retrieval Tuning
- **Top-k selection**: Experiment with different numbers of retrieved chunks
- **Score thresholds**: Filter out low-relevance results
- **Diversity sampling**: Ensure retrieved chunks cover different aspects

## Common Challenges

### Information Retrieval Issues
- **Semantic mismatch**: Query and documents use different terminology
- **Context loss**: Important information split across chunks
- **Hallucination**: Model generates information not in retrieved context

### Solutions
- **Query preprocessing**: Expand queries with synonyms and related terms
- **Overlapping chunks**: Ensure important information appears in multiple chunks
- **Grounding verification**: Check if generated content is supported by retrieved chunks

## Evaluation Metrics

### Retrieval Quality
- **Precision@K**: Fraction of retrieved items that are relevant
- **Recall@K**: Fraction of relevant items that are retrieved
- **MRR**: Mean reciprocal rank of first relevant item

### Generation Quality
- **Faithfulness**: Generated content is supported by retrieved context
- **Relevance**: Generated content answers the user's question
- **Completeness**: Generated content covers all aspects of the question

## Production Considerations

### Scalability
- **Batch processing**: Process large document collections efficiently
- **Incremental updates**: Add new documents without rebuilding entire index
- **Load balancing**: Distribute queries across multiple instances

### Monitoring
- **Query latency**: Track response times for different query types
- **Retrieval quality**: Monitor precision and recall metrics
- **Generation quality**: Track user satisfaction and feedback

### Security
- **Access control**: Restrict access to sensitive documents
- **Query sanitization**: Prevent injection attacks through user queries
- **Audit logging**: Track all queries and responses for compliance
