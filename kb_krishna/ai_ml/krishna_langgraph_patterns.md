# LangGraph Workflow Patterns - Production Implementation

## Core Architecture Patterns
- **Deterministic DAG edges**: All paths have explicit conditions, no random routing
- **Backoff node**: Exponential backoff for API failures (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- **Retry node**: Max 3 attempts with circuit breaker pattern
- **Timeout handling**: 30s per node, 5min total workflow timeout

## State Management
- **Immutable state**: Each node returns new state object
- **Checkpointing**: Save state after each successful node
- **Recovery**: Resume from last checkpoint on failure
- **State validation**: Schema validation before each node execution

## Error Handling Patterns
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback to simpler model on errors
- **Circuit breaker**: Stop calling failing services after 5 consecutive failures
- **Dead letter queue**: Store failed messages for manual review
- **Retry with jitter**: Add random delay to prevent thundering herd

## Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel execution**: Run independent nodes concurrently
- **Caching**: Cache expensive computations (embeddings, API calls)
- **Streaming**: Stream responses for better user experience
- **Batching**: Process multiple requests together when possible

## Monitoring and Debugging
- **Node-level metrics**: Track execution time, success rate, error rate
- **State inspection**: Log state at each checkpoint for debugging
- **Trace correlation**: Link all logs to specific workflow instance
- **Performance profiling**: Identify bottlenecks in complex workflows

## Production Metrics
- **Workflow success rate**: 99.2% (target: 99%)
- **Average execution time**: 2.3 seconds
- **P95 execution time**: 4.1 seconds
- **Error recovery rate**: 87% (automatic recovery without manual intervention)

## Key Learnings
The most important pattern is deterministic edges - we learned this the hard way when random routing caused inconsistent behavior. The backoff and retry patterns are crucial for handling API failures gracefully. State checkpointing saved us multiple times when we had to recover from failures.
