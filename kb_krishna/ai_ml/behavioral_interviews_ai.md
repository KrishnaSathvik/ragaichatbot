## Common Behavioral Questions & Answers

### Leadership Questions
**Q: Tell me about a time you had to lead a team through a difficult technical challenge.**

**A:** At Walgreens, our RAG system was experiencing intermittent failures that were hard to reproduce. I led a 5-person team through a systematic debugging process. We implemented comprehensive logging, created test scenarios, and used a divide-and-conquer approach. I ensured everyone had clear responsibilities and regular check-ins. We identified the issue (race condition in caching) and implemented a fix. The team learned valuable debugging skills, and we established better monitoring practices.

**Q: How do you handle disagreements within your team?**

**A:** During our RAG project, there was disagreement about whether to use Pinecone or build our own vector database. I facilitated a technical evaluation where each team member researched and presented their approach. We created a decision matrix with criteria like cost, performance, and maintenance. After thorough discussion, we chose Pinecone based on data, not opinions. This process taught the team to make data-driven decisions and respect different perspectives.

### Problem-Solving Questions
**Q: Describe a time when you had to learn a new technology quickly.**

**A:** When we decided to implement LangGraph for our RAG system, I had only 2 weeks to become proficient. I created a learning plan: read documentation, built small prototypes, and joined online communities. I also reached out to LangGraph experts for guidance. Within 2 weeks, I built a working prototype and trained the team. This experience taught me the importance of structured learning and leveraging community resources.

**Q: Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned.**

**A:** Early in my career, I deployed a model to production without proper testing, causing a 2-hour outage. I learned that thorough testing and gradual rollouts are crucial. I implemented a comprehensive testing framework and staged deployment process. This failure taught me humility and the importance of process over speed. I now always advocate for proper testing and risk management.

### Collaboration Questions
**Q: How do you handle difficult stakeholders?**

**A:** During our RAG project, the compliance team was initially resistant to AI systems. I scheduled regular meetings to understand their concerns and requirements. I provided detailed documentation and demonstrations to build trust. I also involved them in the design process and addressed their feedback. This collaborative approach turned them into advocates for the system.

**Q: Describe a time you had to influence without authority.**

**A:** I needed to convince the infrastructure team to implement Redis caching for our RAG system, but they had concerns about additional complexity. I created a detailed cost-benefit analysis showing 60% cost savings and 40% performance improvement. I also offered to handle the implementation myself and provide training. They agreed after seeing the data and my commitment to success.
