# ML Pipeline for Patient Demand Forecasting - McKesson

## Project Overview

**Duration:** Mar 2020 – Sep 2020  
**Role:** Data Science Intern  
**Company:** McKesson (USA)  
**Project:** ML Pipeline for Patient Demand Forecasting and Supply Chain Optimization

## Technical Challenge

McKesson needed to improve their patient demand forecasting capabilities to prevent supply mismatches and reduce stockouts. The existing system was causing 22% stockout rate, leading to patient care issues and operational inefficiencies. The challenge was building ML models that could forecast patient demand accurately while developing ETL scripts to reduce data ingestion latency and improve data quality.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the Data Science Intern, I was responsible for:
- Developing ETL and ML scripts in Python that reduced ingestion latency by 50%
- Building regression and time series models that forecasted patient demand
- Creating dashboards for executive decisions on financial integrity
- Implementing data validation and quality improvement processes
- Preventing supply mismatches and reducing stockouts by 22%

## Key Technical Achievements

### ETL Pipeline Development
I developed ETL and ML scripts in Python that reduced ingestion latency by 50%. This was my first real experience with ETL and ML, and it was exciting to see the direct impact on business operations.

**What I accomplished:**
- Built automated ETL scripts using Python for data processing
- Reduced data ingestion latency by 50% through optimization
- Implemented data validation and quality checks
- Created reusable scripts for different data sources

### ML Model Development
I built regression and time series models that forecasted patient demand, preventing supply mismatches and reducing stockouts by 22%. The models directly improved patient care by ensuring medications were available when needed.

**Model achievements:**
- Developed regression models for patient demand forecasting
- Built time series models for seasonal demand patterns
- Implemented model validation and performance monitoring
- Created automated retraining workflows for model freshness

### Data Visualization & Reporting
I created dashboards for executive decisions on financial integrity, providing real-time insights into patient demand patterns and supply chain performance.

**Dashboard features:**
- Built interactive dashboards using Python visualization libraries
- Created executive-level reporting for financial integrity
- Implemented real-time monitoring of demand patterns
- Established alerting systems for supply chain issues

### Process Improvement
I implemented data validation and quality improvement processes that enhanced the reliability and accuracy of the forecasting system.

**Process improvements:**
- Established data quality standards and validation processes
- Implemented automated data profiling and anomaly detection
- Created documentation and best practices for ML workflows
- Built monitoring and alerting systems for data quality

## Technical Architecture

### ML Pipeline Design
```
Data Sources → Python ETL → Data Validation → ML Models → Dashboards → Alerts
