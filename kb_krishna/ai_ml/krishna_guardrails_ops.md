# RAG Guardrails and Operations - Production Learnings

## Security and Safety Measures
- **Prompt injection detection**: 15 patterns caught daily, 0 successful attacks
- **PHI redaction**: 99.7% accuracy using regex + NER models
- **Profanity filtering**: 100% blocked inappropriate content
- **Rate limiting**: 100 requests/minute per user, 1000/minute per IP

## Monitoring and Alerting
- **Canary tests**: Run every 5 minutes, 99.8% pass rate
- **Drift detection**: Monitor embedding distribution weekly
- **Response quality**: Automated scoring on 10% of queries
- **Latency alerts**: Triggered when P95 > 2 seconds

## CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated testing**: 47 test cases covering edge cases
- **Staging validation**: 1000 synthetic queries before production
- **Rollback capability**: <30 seconds to previous version
- **Blue-green deployment**: Zero-downtime updates

## Incident Response
- **P0 incidents**: 2 in 6 months (both resolved in <15 minutes)
- **P1 incidents**: 8 in 6 months (average resolution: 45 minutes)
- **Root cause analysis**: Completed within 24 hours
- **Post-mortem process**: Documented learnings and prevention measures

## Operational Metrics
- **Uptime**: 99.95% (target: 99.9%)
- **Mean time to recovery**: 12 minutes
- **False positive rate**: 0.3% (guardrails triggering incorrectly)
- **Model refresh frequency**: Weekly for embeddings, monthly for LLM

## Key Learnings
The most critical guardrail is prompt injection detection - we catch about 15 attempts per day. The PHI redaction was tricky because healthcare data has many edge cases, but our regex + NER approach works well. The canary tests are essential for catching regressions before they hit users.
