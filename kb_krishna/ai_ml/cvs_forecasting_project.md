# Demand Forecasting ML Models - CVS Health

## Project Overview

**Duration:** Oct 2020 – Dec 2021  
**Role:** ML Engineer  
**Company:** CVS Health (USA)  
**Project:** Demand Forecasting Models for Sales and Supply Chain Optimization

## Technical Challenge

CVS Health needed to improve their demand forecasting capabilities for sales and supply chain optimization. The existing forecasting system was causing procurement inaccuracies and supply mismatches, leading to stockouts and excess inventory. The challenge was building ML models that could predict sales and supply trends accurately while integrating with existing data pipelines and ensuring real-time inference capabilities.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the ML Engineer, I was responsible for:
- Building demand forecasting models in PySpark and TensorFlow
- Engineering feature pipelines with dbt and Databricks for model-ready datasets
- Implementing MLflow for experiment tracking and model management
- Deploying models via Azure ML with comprehensive monitoring
- Optimizing model performance and reducing preparation time by 40%
