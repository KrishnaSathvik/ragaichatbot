# MLOps Pipeline Architecture

## Overview
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) encompasses the practices and tools needed to deploy, monitor, and maintain machine learning models in production environments.

## Core Components

### 1. Model Development
- **Experiment Tracking**: Use MLflow, Weights & Biases, or TensorBoard
- **Version Control**: Track code, data, and model versions
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent environments and dependencies

### 2. Model Training Pipeline
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated data ingestion, validation, and preprocessing
- **Training Orchestration**: Use Airflow, Prefect, or Kubeflow Pipelines
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Automated tuning with Optuna or Ray Tune
- **Model Validation**: Automated testing and performance evaluation

### 3. Model Deployment
- **Containerization**: Package models in Docker containers
- **Orchestration**: Deploy on Kubernetes or cloud services
- **API Gateway**: Expose models through REST or GraphQL APIs
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple model instances

### 4. Model Monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track accuracy, latency, and throughput
- **Data Drift Detection**: Monitor input data distribution changes
- **Model Drift Detection**: Track model performance degradation
- **Alerting**: Set up notifications for critical issues

## MLflow Integration

### Experiment Tracking
```python
import mlflow

# Start experiment
mlflow.set_experiment("customer-churn-prediction")

with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.01)
    mlflow.log_param("epochs", 100)
    
    # Train model
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Log metrics
    accuracy = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
    
    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

### Model Registry
- **Model Versioning**: Track different model versions
- **Staging Workflow**: Promote models through dev → staging → prod
- **Model Metadata**: Store model descriptions, tags, and lineage
- **Automated Deployment**: Trigger deployments based on model performance

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Model Serving with KServe
```yaml
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: customer-churn-model
spec:
  predictor:
    sklearn:
      storageUri: gs://model-registry/churn-model/1
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "2Gi"
        limits:
          cpu: "2"
          memory: "4Gi"
```

### Auto-scaling Configuration
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: Scale based on CPU/memory usage
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler**: Optimize resource allocation
- **Custom Metrics**: Scale based on request latency or queue depth

## Data Pipeline Integration

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
- **Feature Store**: Centralized feature management (Feast, Tecton)
- **Feature Validation**: Ensure feature quality and consistency
- **Feature Serving**: Low-latency feature retrieval for inference
- **Feature Lineage**: Track feature dependencies and transformations

### Data Validation
- **Schema Validation**: Ensure data conforms to expected schema
- **Statistical Validation**: Check data distributions and anomalies
- **Temporal Validation**: Monitor data freshness and completeness
- **Quality Metrics**: Track data quality scores over time

## Monitoring and Observability

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: Track prediction response times
- **Throughput**: Monitor requests per second
- **Error Rates**: Track prediction failures and exceptions
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU, memory, and GPU utilization

### Model Quality Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Track model performance on validation data
- **Precision/Recall**: Monitor classification metrics
- **A/B Testing**: Compare model versions in production
- **Statistical Significance**: Ensure metric differences are meaningful

### Data Drift Detection
- **Statistical Tests**: Use KS test, PSI, or KL divergence
- **Feature Importance**: Track changes in feature importance
- **Distribution Monitoring**: Visualize feature distributions over time
- **Alerting Thresholds**: Set up alerts for significant drift

## Best Practices

### Model Lifecycle Management
- **Automated Retraining**: Trigger retraining based on performance degradation
- **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy new models to small traffic percentages first
- **Rollback Strategy**: Quick rollback to previous model version
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime model updates

### Security and Compliance
- **Model Encryption**: Encrypt models at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access to models and data
- **Audit Logging**: Track all model access and predictions
- **GDPR Compliance**: Handle data privacy and right to be forgotten

### Cost Optimization
- **Resource Right-sizing**: Optimize CPU/memory allocation
- **Spot Instances**: Use spot instances for training workloads
- **Model Compression**: Reduce model size with quantization or pruning
- **Caching**: Cache predictions for repeated queries

## Tools and Platforms
