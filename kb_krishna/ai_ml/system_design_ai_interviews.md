# AI/ML System Design Interview Guide - Krishna's Approach

## Introduction
**Krishna's System Design Philosophy:**
Having designed and deployed production GenAI and RAG systems at Walgreens, I approach system design interviews by focusing on scalability, reliability, and real-world constraints. My experience with LangChain, LangGraph, and vector databases gives me practical insights into building AI systems that work in enterprise environments.

## Core AI System Design Principles

### 1. Scalability Patterns
**Krishna's Scalability Approach:**
- **Horizontal scaling**: Design for stateless services that can scale independently
- **Caching layers**: Multiple cache levels (query, embedding, response)
- **Async processing**: Use async patterns for I/O-heavy operations
- **Load balancing**: Distribute load across multiple instances

**Example Architecture:**
```
User Query → Load Balancer → API Gateway → RAG Service Cluster
                                    ↓
                              Embedding Cache (Redis)
                                    ↓
                              Vector DB (Pinecone)
                                    ↓
                              LLM Service (OpenAI)
                                    ↓
                              Response Cache (Redis)
```

### 2. Reliability & Fault Tolerance
**Krishna's Reliability Patterns:**
- **Circuit breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Retry mechanisms**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Fallback strategies**: Graceful degradation when services fail
- **Health checks**: Monitor service health continuously

**Real Example from Walgreens:**
When OpenAI API was down, our system automatically fell back to cached responses and notified users about potential delays. This maintained 95% availability during the outage.

## Common AI System Design Questions

### Question 1: Design a RAG System for Enterprise Knowledge Base

**Krishna's Approach:**

**Requirements Gathering:**
- Scale: 10M documents, 1000 concurrent users
- Latency: <2 seconds response time
- Accuracy: 90%+ relevant responses
- Compliance: HIPAA, audit trails

**High-Level Architecture:**
```
Data Sources → Ingestion Pipeline → Vector Store → Query Service → Response Generation
     ↓              ↓                    ↓             ↓              ↓
  PDFs/Texts    Chunking &         Pinecone/      FastAPI        GPT-4 with
  APIs/DBs      Embedding          Weaviate       Service        Context
```

**Detailed Components:**

1. **Data Ingestion Layer:**
   - Document processors for PDFs, Word docs, web pages
   - Chunking strategy: 800-1000 tokens with 100-token overlap
   - Metadata extraction: source, timestamp, document type
   - Quality validation: content filtering, deduplication

2. **Embedding & Storage:**
   - OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for embeddings
   - Vector database: Pinecone for managed hosting
   - Metadata filtering: document type, access permissions
   - Incremental updates: only process changed documents

3. **Query Processing:**
   - Query preprocessing: normalization, intent detection
   - Hybrid retrieval: semantic + keyword search
   - Reranking: cross-encoder for better relevance
   - Context assembly: top-k chunks with overlap handling

4. **Response Generation:**
   - Prompt engineering: structured templates with guardrails
   - Model selection: GPT-4 for accuracy, GPT-3.5-turbo for speed
   - Response validation: factuality checks, citation requirements
   - Post-processing: formatting, PII masking

**Scalability Considerations:**
- **Caching**: Query embeddings (24h TTL), responses (1h TTL)
- **Load balancing**: Round-robin with health checks
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale based on CPU and memory usage
- **Database sharding**: Partition by document type or date

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- **Metrics**: Latency, accuracy, cache hit rate, error rate
- **Logging**: Structured logs with correlation IDs
- **Alerting**: P95 latency >3s, error rate >1%
- **Dashboards**: Real-time performance monitoring

### Question 2: Design a Multi-Modal AI System

**Krishna's Approach:**

**Requirements:**
- Process text, images, and audio inputs
- Generate responses in multiple formats
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- Real-time processing for audio

**Architecture:**
```
Input Router → Processing Pipeline → Fusion Layer → Response Generator
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
  Text/Image/    Specialized         Multi-modal    Format-specific
  Audio Input    Processors          Fusion         Output
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Input Processing:**
   - Text: Direct embedding generation
   - Images: Vision model (CLIP, DALL-E) for embeddings
   - Audio: Speech-to-text → text embeddings

2. **Fusion Strategy:**
   - Early fusion: Combine embeddings before retrieval
   - Late fusion: Process modalities separately, combine results
   - Cross-modal attention: Learn relationships between modalities

3. **Response Generation:**
   - Multi-modal prompts: Include image descriptions, audio transcripts
   - Format selection: Choose output format based on input type
   - Consistency checks: Ensure responses align across modalities

### Question 3: Design an AI Agent System

**Krishna's Approach:**

**Requirements:**
- Autonomous task execution
- Tool integration (APIs, databases, external services)
- Memory and context management
- Human-in-the-loop capabilities

**Architecture using LangGraph:**
```
User Input → Intent Classification → Tool Selection → Execution → Validation → Response
     ↓              ↓                    ↓             ↓           ↓          ↓
  Query         Router Node         Tool Node      Result     Quality     Formatted
  Analysis      (LangGraph)        (LangGraph)    Node       Check       Response
```

**LangGraph Implementation:**
```python
from langgraph import StateGraph, END

def create_agent_workflow():
    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Add nodes
    workflow.add_node("classify_intent", classify_intent)
    workflow.add_node("select_tool", select_tool)
    workflow.add_node("execute_tool", execute_tool)
    workflow.add_node("validate_result", validate_result)
    workflow.add_node("format_response", format_response)
    
    # Add edges
    workflow.add_edge("classify_intent", "select_tool")
    workflow.add_edge("select_tool", "execute_tool")
    workflow.add_edge("execute_tool", "validate_result")
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "validate_result",
        should_retry,
        {
            "retry": "select_tool",
            "continue": "format_response",
            "end": END
        }
    )
    workflow.add_edge("format_response", END)
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **State management**: Immutable state objects with checkpointing
- **Error handling**: Circuit breakers and retry mechanisms
- **Tool integration**: Standardized tool interface with validation
- **Memory**: Conversation history and context management
