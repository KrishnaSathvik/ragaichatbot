# Delta Lake Optimizations - Walgreens Data Pipeline

## Performance Optimizations Implemented
- **OPTIMIZE command**: Run weekly on all Delta tables
- **ZORDER clustering**: On (customer_id, date) for 60% faster queries
- **File compaction**: Weekly compaction reduces files from 10,000 to 2,000
- **Skew handling**: Salting strategy for skewed customer data

## Before Optimization Metrics
- **Query performance**: P95 latency 45 seconds
- **File count**: 10,000+ small files per table
- **Storage efficiency**: 40% wasted space due to small files
- **Maintenance overhead**: 2 hours daily for manual optimization

## After Optimization Results
- **Query performance**: P95 latency 18 seconds (60% improvement)
- **File count**: 2,000 files per table (80% reduction)
- **Storage efficiency**: 15% wasted space (62% improvement)
- **Maintenance overhead**: 30 minutes weekly (automated)

## Specific Optimizations
1. **ZORDER on (customer_id, date)**: Most common query pattern
2. **File size target**: 128MB per file (optimal for Parquet)
3. **Salting for skew**: Add random suffix to high-cardinality keys
4. **VACUUM policy**: Remove files older than 7 days
5. **Auto-compaction**: Trigger when file count > 1000

## Monitoring and Alerts
- **Query performance**: Alert when P95 > 30 seconds
- **File count**: Alert when > 5000 files per table
- **Storage growth**: Monitor daily growth rate
- **Compaction success**: Track weekly compaction completion

## Cost Impact
- **Storage costs**: Reduced by 25% through better compression
- **Compute costs**: 40% reduction in query execution time
- **Maintenance costs**: 75% reduction in manual optimization time
- **Total savings**: $15,000/month across all environments

## Lessons Learned
The biggest impact came from ZORDER clustering - it improved query performance by 60% with minimal overhead. File compaction was crucial for reducing the small file problem. The salting strategy for skewed data was tricky to implement but essential for consistent performance.
