# Enterprise Data Platform Migration - Walgreens

## Project Overview

**Duration:** Feb 2022 – Present  
**Role:** Data Engineer  
**Company:** TCS (Walgreens, USA)  
**Project:** Enterprise Data Platform Migration from Legacy Systems to Azure

## Technical Challenge

Walgreens had a complex data landscape with multiple legacy systems (Informatica, Oracle, SQL Server) that were creating data silos and making it difficult to get a unified view of business operations. The challenge was migrating 200+ legacy Informatica workflows to a modern Azure-based data platform while processing 10TB+ monthly data across healthcare, retail, pharmacy, and supply chain domains. The system needed to support 500+ downstream analytics users with improved data freshness from T+2 days to T+4 hours.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the Data Engineer, I was responsible for:
- Building and optimizing data pipelines that process healthcare, retail, pharmacy, and supply chain data
- Implementing medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) with proper schema enforcement
- Migrating 200+ legacy Informatica workflows to Databricks
- Designing scalable data lake architectures on Azure with Delta Lake format
- Reducing data pipeline costs by 35% through optimization

## Key Technical Achievements

### Data Pipeline Development
I built end-to-end data pipelines using Databricks + PySpark, processing sales, pharmacy, customer loyalty, and supply chain data. I implemented a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) with proper schema enforcement, deduplication, and business logic.

**What I accomplished:**
- Migrated 200+ legacy Informatica workflows to Databricks
- Processed 10TB+ monthly data across multiple business domains
- Improved data freshness from T+2 days to T+4 hours
- Reduced data pipeline costs by 35% through optimization

### Medallion Architecture Implementation
I designed scalable data lake architectures on Azure with Delta Lake format, which enabled ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel. I partitioned the data by date, state, and product category for optimal query performance.

**Architecture components:**
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion with schema validation
- **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing, validation, and business rule application
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready datasets for analytics and reporting
- **Delta Lake**: ACID transactions, schema evolution, time travel capabilities

### Performance Optimization
I optimized data pipelines for performance and cost efficiency, implementing partitioning strategies, caching mechanisms, and query optimization techniques. This resulted in significant cost savings and improved performance.

**Optimization achievements:**
- Reduced data pipeline costs by 35% through efficient resource utilization
- Implemented intelligent partitioning strategies for optimal query performance
- Built automated monitoring and alerting for pipeline health
- Established data quality frameworks and validation processes

### Data Governance & Security
I implemented comprehensive data governance frameworks with Unity Catalog, ensuring data security, compliance, and lineage tracking across all data pipelines.

**Governance measures:**
- Implemented Unity Catalog for data governance and lineage tracking
- Established data quality standards and validation processes
- Created automated monitoring and alerting systems
- Ensured compliance with healthcare data regulations

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline Design
```
Legacy Systems → Azure Data Factory → Databricks → Delta Lake → Analytics
    ↓                ↓                    ↓           ↓           ↓
Informatica → Orchestration → PySpark → Storage → Power BI/Users
```

### Key Technologies Used
- **Data Processing**: PySpark, Databricks, Delta Lake
- **Cloud Platforms**: Azure (Data Factory, Synapse, Storage)
