# ETL Optimization for Healthcare Data Processing - McKesson

## Project Overview

**Duration:** Mar 2020 – Sep 2020  
**Role:** Data Science Intern  
**Company:** McKesson (USA)  
**Project:** ETL Optimization for Healthcare Data Processing and Analytics

## Technical Challenge

McKesson had ETL processes that were taking too long to run and costing too much. The data preparation was manual and error-prone, causing delays in analytics and reporting. The challenge was optimizing ETL processes to reduce ingestion latency, improve data quality, and create automated data processing workflows that could handle large volumes of healthcare data efficiently.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the Data Science Intern, I was responsible for:
- Building automated ETL scripts using Python that reduced ingestion latency by 50%
- Implementing proper data validation and quality checks
- Creating feature pipelines that standardized data preparation across teams
- Optimizing data processing workflows for better performance
- Establishing data quality standards and monitoring processes

## Key Technical Achievements

### ETL Script Optimization
I built automated ETL scripts using Python that reduced ingestion latency by 50% and implemented proper data validation. This was crucial for improving data processing efficiency and reliability.

**What I accomplished:**
- Reduced data ingestion latency by 50% through script optimization
- Implemented automated data validation and quality checks
- Created reusable ETL scripts for different data sources
- Established error handling and recovery processes

### Data Quality Framework
I implemented comprehensive data validation and quality improvement processes that enhanced the reliability and accuracy of the data processing system.

**Quality measures:**
- Built automated data validation and quality checks
- Implemented data profiling and anomaly detection
- Created data quality monitoring and alerting systems
- Established data lineage tracking and documentation

### Process Standardization
I created feature pipelines that standardized data preparation across teams, reducing manual effort and improving consistency.

**Standardization achievements:**
- Built reusable data processing templates
- Created standardized data preparation workflows
- Implemented consistent data validation across all processes
- Established best practices and documentation

### Performance Optimization
I optimized data processing workflows for better performance and cost efficiency, implementing various optimization techniques.

**Optimization results:**
- Improved data processing performance significantly
- Reduced computational costs through efficient resource utilization
- Implemented intelligent data partitioning strategies
- Built automated monitoring and alerting for performance issues

## Technical Architecture

### ETL Pipeline Design
```
Data Sources → Python ETL → Data Validation → Quality Checks → Processed Data
    ↓            ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
Raw Data → Processing → Validation → Quality → Analytics/ML
```
