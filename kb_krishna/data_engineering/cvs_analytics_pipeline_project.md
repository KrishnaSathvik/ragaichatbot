# Analytics Pipeline for Demand Forecasting - CVS Health

## Project Overview

**Duration:** Oct 2020 – Dec 2021  
**Role:** Analytics Engineer  
**Company:** CVS Health (USA)  
**Project:** Analytics Pipeline for Demand Forecasting and Supply Chain Analytics

## Technical Challenge

CVS Health needed to build analytics pipelines to support demand forecasting and supply chain optimization. The existing data infrastructure was fragmented, making it difficult to provide clean, model-ready datasets for ML models. The challenge was building scalable analytics pipelines that could process large volumes of sales, inventory, and supply chain data while ensuring data quality and consistency for downstream ML applications.

## My Role & Responsibilities

As the Analytics Engineer, I was responsible for:
- Building demand forecasting pipelines in PySpark + TensorFlow
- Creating analytics datasets for ML model training and inference
- Implementing data quality frameworks and validation processes
- Optimizing data processing performance and reducing costs
- Ensuring data consistency and reliability across analytics workflows
