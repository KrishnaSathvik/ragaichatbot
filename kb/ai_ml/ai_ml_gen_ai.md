## Project Intro (Real-World AI/ML/GenAI Example)

In my recent AI/ML project at Walgreens, I worked as an AI/ML Engineer to design and deploy a **GenAI-powered knowledge assistant** for pharmacy operations. The solution integrated a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** where customer FAQs and policy documents were ingested, chunked, and stored in a **vector database (Pinecone)**. We built embeddings using **OpenAI + Hugging Face models**, enabling pharmacists to query compliance or medication rules in natural language with citations. The ingestion pipelines were built in **Databricks + PySpark**, transforming structured and unstructured data (text, PDFs, call transcripts) into embedding-friendly formats.

For orchestration, we leveraged **Airflow** to automate nightly ingestion, retraining, and re-indexing jobs. The inference pipeline was deployed via **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** with scalable APIs. We used **MLflow** for experiment tracking and **Azure DevOps CI/CD** to deploy models into production with rollback safety. Governance was enforced with **Unity Catalog + custom PII scrubbing** before embedding sensitive data. Performance tuning included prompt optimization, few-shot examples, and caching embeddings for high-frequency queries, which reduced inference latency by 40%.

This project gave me **end-to-end GenAI + ML Ops experience**: ingestion, embeddings, vector search, model deployment, monitoring, and governance. It also showcased the ability to bridge **data engineering foundations with AI/ML innovation**, aligning with enterprise needs for compliance, scalability, and cost efficiency.

# ðŸ“‘ Resume Optimization Framework â€“ AI/ML/GenAI Version

## 1. Structure & Bullet Rules

**5-4-3-2 Rule**

- Walgreens â†’ 5 bullets | Present tense | Outcome + metrics | Core tech (RAG, GenAI, PySpark, Databricks)
- CVS â†’ 4 bullets | Past tense | ML pipelines + forecasting | TensorFlow, Databricks, dbt
- McKesson â†’ 3 bullets | Past tense | Forecasting + compliance outcomes | Python + ML models
- Inditek â†’ 2 bullets | Past tense | Developer foundation | APIs + SQL

**Character Constraint Rule**

- Each bullet = **220â€“240 characters**
- Never <215, never >240

---

## 2. Domain Adaptation Layer

Adapt **vocabulary + emphasis** per JD:

- GenAI/LLMs â†’ RAG, vector DBs, embeddings, LangChain, prompt optimization
- ML Engineering â†’ model training, feature pipelines, MLflow, deployment
- Data + AI â†’ hybrid roles bridging ingestion, ELT, and ML ops
- Compliance/Healthcare â†’ HIPAA, lineage, governance for AI outputs

---

## 3. Skills Optimization Layer

**Always keep 6 categories:**

1. AI/ML & GenAI
2. Data Engineering & ELT
3. Cloud Platforms
4. Databases & Storage
5. Analytics & BI
6. DevOps & Governance

**JD Alignment:**

- Re-order tools inside categories (AWS ML before Azure ML if JD says AWS)
- Highlight GenAI (LangChain, OpenAI, vector DBs) when relevant
- Strictly ATS-optimized, no jargon

---

## 4. Verb Rotation Rule

Rotate verbs: **Engineer, Optimize, Automate, Deploy, Develop, Train, Fine-tune, Implement, Orchestrate, Scale, Monitor**

---

## 5. Metrics Bank Rule

Every bullet ties to measurable outcome:

- % improvements (latency -40%, accuracy +18%)
- Scale (10TB+, 200+ models tracked, 1M+ embeddings)
- Cost savings (\$15M+ savings, 30% infra cost cut)
- Risk/Compliance outcomes (HIPAA alignment, audit-ready insights)
- User impact (pharmacists saved 60% manual search time)

3. **Reorder Skills** â†’ Keep 6 categories, move JD-priority tools up front.
4. **Rewrite Bullets** â†’ Use 5-4-3-2, adjust tech names, keep measurable outcomes.
5. **Rotate Verbs** â†’ Ensure diversity, no repetition.
6. **Check Character Count** â†’ 220â€“240 characters each.
7. **Final Scan** â†’ ATS keywords aligned, outcomes present, tense correct.
