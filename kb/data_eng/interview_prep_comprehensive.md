# Comprehensive Data Engineering Interview Preparation

## Latest Interview Questions & Topics

Over the past few months, I've been actively preparing for Data Engineering interviews, and I thought of sharing some of the latest questions I came across. These focus on Spark, SQL, Python, and Databricks, the core skills for most modern data engineering roles.

### üîπ Spark Questions

**Explain Spark architecture ‚Äì how do driver, executors, and cluster manager interact?**
- Driver program coordinates the job execution and communicates with cluster manager
- Cluster manager (YARN, Mesos, or standalone) allocates resources across the cluster
- Executors run tasks and store data in memory/disk, report back to driver
- Driver sends tasks to executors, collects results, and manages the overall job

**Difference between narrow vs. wide transformations with examples.**
- Narrow transformations: map(), filter(), union() - no data movement between partitions
- Wide transformations: groupBy(), join(), distinct() - requires shuffling data across partitions
- Wide transformations are expensive and should be minimized for performance

**How do you optimize Spark jobs (partitioning, caching, broadcast joins)?**
- Partition data appropriately based on query patterns (usually date-based)
- Cache frequently accessed DataFrames in memory
- Use broadcast joins for small lookup tables
- Tune spark.sql.shuffle.partitions based on cluster size
- Use coalesce() instead of repartition() when reducing partitions

**What happens when you run df.explain() in Spark?**
- Shows the logical and physical execution plans
- Displays optimization decisions made by Catalyst optimizer
- Helps identify bottlenecks, unnecessary shuffles, or missing optimizations
- Can use df.explain(true) for extended physical plan details

### üîπ SQL Questions

**Write a query to get the second highest salary without using TOP or LIMIT.**
```sql
-- Using window function
SELECT salary 
FROM (
    SELECT salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE rn = 2;

-- Using subquery
SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

-- Using self-join
SELECT DISTINCT e1.salary
FROM employees e1, employees e2
WHERE e1.salary < e2.salary
GROUP BY e1.salary
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
```

**Explain QUALIFY with an example.**
```sql
-- QUALIFY filters results of window functions without subquery
SELECT name, salary, department,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
FROM employees
QUALIFY rn <= 3;  -- Top 3 earners per department
```

**Difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, FULL JOIN, and CROSS JOIN.**
- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows from both tables
- LEFT JOIN: All rows from left table + matching rows from right table
- FULL JOIN: All rows from both tables (union of LEFT and RIGHT)
- CROSS JOIN: Cartesian product of all rows from both tables

**How do you handle incremental loads in SQL?**
- Use watermark columns (modified_date, created_date)
- Implement CDC (Change Data Capture) patterns
- Use MERGE statements for upsert operations
- Track last processed timestamp in control tables

### üîπ Python Questions

**How would you reverse a string without using built-in functions?**
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        result += s[i]
    return result

# Alternative approach
def reverse_string_slicing(s):
    return s[::-1]
```

**Write code to find duplicates in a list.**
```python
def find_duplicates(lst):
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()
    for item in lst:
        if item in seen:
            duplicates.add(item)
        else:
            seen.add(item)
    return list(duplicates)

# Using collections.Counter
from collections import Counter
def find_duplicates_counter(lst):
    counts = Counter(lst)
    return [item for item, count in counts.items() if count > 1]
```

**Difference between @staticmethod, @classmethod, and instance methods.**
- Instance methods: Take self, access instance attributes
- Class methods: Take cls, access class attributes, can create new instances
- Static methods: Don't take self or cls, utility functions that don't need class/instance data

**Explain Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock).**
- GIL prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously
- Only one thread can execute Python code at a time
- Affects CPU-bound tasks but not I/O-bound tasks
- Can be bypassed using multiprocessing or C extensions

### üîπ Databricks Questions

**How do you implement Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture in Databricks?**
- Bronze: Raw ingested data with schema flexibility
- Silver: Cleaned, validated, deduplicated data with enforced schemas
- Gold: Business-ready aggregated and modeled data for analytics
- Use Delta Lake for ACID transactions and schema evolution

**Difference between Delta Lake and traditional parquet tables.**
- Delta Lake: ACID transactions, schema enforcement, time travel, upserts
- Parquet: Immutable, append-only, no built-in transaction support
- Delta Lake provides better reliability and governance capabilities

**How do you manage incremental data load using Delta Lake?**
```python
# Using MERGE for upserts
df.write.format("delta").mode("append").option("mergeSchema", "true").save("/path/to/table")

# Or using merge operation
from delta.tables import DeltaTable
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/path/to/table")
deltaTable.alias("target").merge(
    source_df.alias("source"),
    "target.id = source.id"
).whenMatchedUpdateAll().whenNotMatchedInsertAll().execute()
```

**Explain Unity Catalog and its role in governance.**
- Centralized metadata store for data governance
- Provides fine-grained access control at table/column level
- Enables data lineage tracking and discovery
- Supports PII masking and row-level security
- Integrates with external identity providers

## üîç Why Most People Struggle in Data Engineering Interviews

I've seen this pattern again and again ‚Äî candidates know the tools, but the moment the interviewer shifts from "what is Spark?" to "design a pipeline for streaming data," things start to fall apart.

**The truth?** Data Engineering interviews test how you think, not just what you know.

### Mental Framework for Interviews:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **SQL is your foundation** ‚Üí If you can't join, aggregate, and optimize queries, nothing else will stand.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model the data** ‚Üí Understand when to use star schema vs. snowflake, OLTP vs. OLAP, and how to handle Slowly Changing Dimensions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Think scale** ‚Üí Spark, partitioning, shuffles, streaming late-arrival data ‚Äî these aren't buzzwords, they're the backbone of real-world DE systems.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Design pipelines, not scripts** ‚Üí Batch vs. streaming, orchestration with Airflow, partitioning strategies ‚Äî show that you can think like an architect.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Zoom out** ‚Üí Cloud (S3, Redshift, BigQuery, Synapse), data lake vs. warehouse vs. lakehouse ‚Äî interviews often end with "how would you design this end-to-end?"

## Databricks-Specific Interview Preparation

Databricks is the home of Apache Spark and the Lakehouse Platform. Engineers here focus on real-time data, ML pipelines, and large-scale analytics.

    # Check for outliers (amount > 3 standard deviations)
    amount_stats = df.select(mean('amount'), stddev('amount')).collect()[0]
    outlier_count = df.filter(col('amount') > (amount_stats[0] + 3 * amount_stats[1])).count()

```

7Ô∏è‚É£ **In PySpark, how would you efficiently join two very large DataFrames to avoid skew?**
```python

## Key Success Factors for Data Engineering Interviews

1. **Technical Depth**: Understand the "why" behind tools and technologies
2. **System Design**: Think about scalability, reliability, and maintainability
3. **Problem Solving**: Break down complex problems into manageable pieces
4. **Communication**: Explain technical concepts clearly and concisely
5. **Real-world Experience**: Draw from actual project experiences and challenges
6. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with latest trends and best practices

Remember: Interviewers want to see how you think through problems, not just memorized answers. Focus on demonstrating your analytical approach and practical experience.
