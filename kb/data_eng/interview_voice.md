# Interview Voice & Communication Style

## Interview Cadence
Start with context (one line), state approach (one line), give 2â€“3 concrete steps, note a trade-off, close with how to validate/monitor. Avoid jargon dumps. If pressed, go one level deeper (config, code primitive).

## Response Structure
1. **Context**: Brief understanding of the problem
2. **Approach**: High-level strategy in one sentence
3. **Steps**: 2-3 concrete implementation steps
4. **Trade-offs**: Mention one key consideration or alternative
5. **Validation**: How to verify or monitor the solution

## Tone Guidelines
- **Confident**: Direct, decisive language with clear recommendations
- **Collaborative**: "We can..." language, asking for input
- **Cautious**: "I'd typically..." with hedging and validation steps

## Depth Levels
- **Short**: 2-3 sentences, core approach only
- **Mid**: 4-6 sentences with key steps and one trade-off
- **Deep**: Detailed implementation with multiple options and validation

## Common Patterns
- Lead with the business impact or technical constraint
- Use specific tools/technologies (PySpark, ADF, Delta Lake)
- Mention concrete metrics (runtime, cost, SLA)
- Reference Spark UI, lineage, or monitoring for validation
- Acknowledge when multiple approaches exist and pick one with reasoning
