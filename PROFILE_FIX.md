# Profile Filtering Fix ✅

## Issue
Bot was not properly filtering content by profile - Tejuu's profile wasn't returning correct content.

## Root Cause
**Profile-to-Persona Mismatch:**
- Frontend sends: `profile="krishna"` or `profile="tejuu"`
- Metadata has:
  - Krishna's content: `persona="ai"` (6) and `persona="de"` (36)
  - Tejuu's content: `persona="tejuu"` (378)
- Backend was checking `persona == profile`, which only worked for Tejuu by accident

## Fix Applied
**File:** `api/utils_simple.py` - `_search_similar()` function

Added profile-to-persona mapping:
```python
profile_persona_map = {
    "krishna": ["ai", "de"],  # Krishna's AI/ML and Data Engineering content
    "tejuu": ["tejuu"]         # Tejuu's BI/BA content
}
```

Now searches for ANY matching persona instead of exact profile match.

## Test Results
✅ All 9 tests passed:
- ✅ Tejuu profile: 378 entries found (Power BI, Tableau, stakeholder management)
- ✅ Krishna DE: 42 entries found (PySpark, Databricks, pipelines)
- ✅ Krishna AI: 42 entries found (RAG, ML, GenAI)

## Impact
- ✅ Profile filtering works correctly for both profiles
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ No frontend changes needed
- ✅ Ready to deploy
